                    <p><center>Broadly categorized, there were three main trends in 1960s womenswear: 1 the lady-like elegance inherited from the previous decade seen on the likes of First Lady Jacqueline Kennedy, 2) the fun, youthful designs popularized by Swinging London, and 3) the Eastern-influenced hippie styles of the late 1960s. Along with these diverse styles, there came a shift in the way that women shopped and for whom the styles were created.
                        In the early years of the decade, fashion continued along the lines of the 1950s. Skirt suits and coordinating accessories were emphasized as one decade transitioned into the next.While the miniskirt reached its height mid-decade, by the late 1960s, a new style and culture was emerging. Skirts dipped back to mid-calf and by 1969, the full-length maxi-skirt had emerged . This came with the move towards the “hippie” aesthetic. Elizabeth Wilson writes in Gerta Buxbaum’s Icons of Fashion: The Twentieth Century, “Between 1965 and 1967, the uncluttered, futuristic design of André Courrèges and Mary Quant – featuring short skirts, childish pinafores, and boxy shapes – were superseded by a return to the styles of Art Nouveau, Hollywood, and William Morris” (98). Suede, headbands, kaftans, Afghan coats, beads and other non-Western elements of adornment were embraced as were flowing skirts and secondhand clothing (Laver 267-268). Janis Joplin, embraced this style in the late 1960s.
                    
                        Both the “Mod” movement, to which Quant contributed, and the hippie movement were part of a new model of “street style” in which fashion is disseminated from the streets up to the designers rather than vice versa. Jane Mulvagh writes in Icons of Fashion, “1962 to 1968 were crucial years in which the allure and originality of street style challenged, and finally broke, the hegemony of high fashion” (86). The trajectory of fashion in the 1960s saw three very diverse overarching styles but also a shift from a designer-centric fashion ecosystem to one where the consumer was at the center of creation.</center></p>

                    <p><center>Music in the 1960's was as diverse and revolutionary as the movements that inspired the nation.  A dramatic rise in the popularity of Rock and Roll music, self expression and resistance to the status quo leads to a sound of American youth and adventure that inspires a nation.  

                        Bands like the Beatles from Liverpool England captivate the nation while bands like the Beach Boys emerge portraying the dreams of California living and a more traditional way of life.  Artists like Bob Dylan and the Rolling Stones also take the music scene by storm, but we will take a look at their music when we explore Hippie culture in the United States.  
                        
                        It was a time of musical experimentation and with half of the population in their youth these new sounds were sure to say.The ultimate pop phenomenon, they appeared everywhere in the '60s: on TV, movie screens, magazine covers, lunch boxes, dolls, dishes and more. Beatlemania influences hairstyles and clothing, but most of all, the Beatles revolutionized music. The Rock&Roll Hall of Fame puts it this way: "They literally stood the world of pop culture on its head, setting the musical agenda for the remainder of the decade."
                    
                        Beatlemania hits the U.S. on February 9, 1964, when the Beatles appear on the Ed Sullivan Show Forty percent of the country watches and soon after divides into camps of worshipful fans, and critics upset by the boys' long hairstyles and beatnik attitudes. The fans win: on April 4, 1964, the Beatles hold the five top positions on the Billboard pop chart, a feat never achieved before—or since.</center></p>
