                    <p><center>A decade typified by its “power dressing,” the 1980s actually opened with stylish sportswear and the soft “New Romantics” style. Carrying on from the late 1970s trend for sportswear and encouraged by a fitness craze, women increasingly wore stylish gym wear in their day-to-day life. This was captured in Jennifer Beals’ attire in the 1983 movie Flashdance. Dance-wear inspired fashion including off-the-shoulder sweatshirts and leggings, while Jane Fonda’s exercise videos also encouraged these styles.Though the dominant trend of the 1980s was bigger is better, taffeta and bright colors, other designers emerged and created their own styles.  For daywear, American designers such as Perry Ellis and Ralph Lauren turned to classic styles menswear styles such as blazers, button downs and hand-knit sweaters to create casually elegant womenswear . These styles came to represent casual American style and were adopted as a “preppy” style in the US (“preppy” referencing the elite preparatory schools attended by wealthy teens).The style was influenced by traditional Ivy League and Seven Sisters style, as well as the dress of early twentieth-century British aristocrats . In her book Seven Sisters Style, Rebecca C. Tuite writes, “Lauren’s interpretation of the collegiate look was never a costume or a disguise; it was an understated appreciation of good, classic style” . The plaid Perry Ellis suit  pays homage to late 1940s and early 1950s collegiate style. Tuite continues to note that the look was interpreted in many ways throughout the decade: “The preppy fashions of the 1980s ranged from understated and classic to gaudy and ironic” .

                        On the other side of the world, a shocking new type of fashion emerged from Japan. De la Haye and Tucker write, “The clothes of innovative Japanese designers, who continued to show in Paris, offered a stark and often startling alternative to Western styles” . Designers such as Comme des Garçons’ Rei Kawakubo and Yohji Yamamoto employed deconstruction, exaggerated proportions and to transform how clothing interacted with the body. This resulted in shocking styles that differed from the typical styles of the decade. Their predominant use of black would continue into the early 1990s as the power dressing of the eighties began to evolve towards the minimalism of the subsequent decade. </center></p>

                    <p><center>We’ve taken you through a journey of the sounds and artists that defined the 1970s music scene, and today we explore the transformative music of the 1980s.

                        The 80s marked a vibrant and revolutionary era in music that shaped the musical landscape of its time, and continues to echo through the sounds of contemporary artists. Two out of six of the best-selling albums of all time (Michael Jackson’s Thriller, and AC/DC’s Back in Black) were released in the 80s, and included some of the most timeless and celebrated 1980 songs. 
                        
                        Defined by infectious melodies, synthesizer-driven beats, and a spectacle of genres, 80s music left a lasting mark on the world, and a legacy that persists to this day.The 80s music scene was characterized by a diverse range of styles. From Michael Jackson's infectious pop tunes, to the anthemic rock tracks of bands like U2 and Guns N' Roses, the decade really embraced an eclectic mix of sounds. 
                    
                        The use of synthesizers and electronic instruments gained popularity during this time, birthing the era of a new wave of musical exploration, with bands like Depeche Mode and Duran Duran at the forefront. Artists were able to experiment with different textures and sounds that had never been attempted before, creating catchy, futuristic beats that became pivotal in shaping the decade’s sonic identity.Artists like The Weeknd, with his album After Hours, and Dua Lipa's Future Nostalgia seamlessly blend modern pop with elements of 80s dance music, by weaving synth-heavy production and retro energy within their infectious hooks and bouncy verses. 
                    
                        Meanwhile, the innovative electro-pop duo Daft Punk’s sound clearly draws influence from the era's electronic influences. They infuse their music with futuristic sounds that pay homage to distinct 80s influences, highlighting the enduring impact of 80s music.
                        
                        The distinct aesthetics and sonic landscapes of the 80s have transcended time and genres to inform the likes of experimental Indie Rock bands The 1975 and Arctic Monkeys, who also owe their sound to the influence of nostalgic 80s songs. 
                        
                        Their incorporation of the retro undertones and sonic experimentation reminiscent of the decade, with the musical interpretation of the Indie Sleaze movement, captivated the hearts of female fans (in particular) worldwide and defined its own genre.</center></p>
