    <p><center> At the dawn of the 1920s, the world was still reeling from the First World War. The conflict, which ended just over a year before the new decade began, had a fundamental and irreversible effect on society, culture, and fashion. </center></p>
    <p><center> Fashion in the 1920s was all about the whole look and there were trends in how the body itself was fashioned. The simple lines and androgynous shapes of fashion looked best on bodies free from curves. Through exercise, diet, and various shaping undergarments, women attempted to achieve this look. The sporting look also helped facilitate a mode for suntanned skin. Many women cut their hair into a bob, a popular hairstyle that emerged early in the decade. Hairstyles kept getting shorter first with the shingle and then with the Eton crop, but like hemlines, as the decade drew to a close, women were starting to grow their hair longer again. The cloche hat became an extremely popular accessory that looked best with these short hairstyles.

    While the designers mentioned above created and sold their styles, as did department stores and the like, the simplicity of the prevailing mode throughout the twenties made it easy for women of all means to recreate those styles at home. This, combined with inspiration taken from typical working-class girls attire and the use of materials such as jersey and artificial silk, led to what has been deemed a “democratization of fashion” in the 1920s. Anyone could achieve the fashionable look even if it meant the simple lines were created with a less expensive material and made at home rather than in an atelier. This phenomenon is studied by fashion historians but was also felt during the period. In her book Success Through Dress, The Hon. Mrs. C.W Forester declared, “Dress is now no sign of social status; in fact, rather the contrary” . There is many famous designers such as Gabrielle Coco Chanel, Elsa Schiaparelli, Jeanne Lanvin, Jean Patou and Paul Poiret</center></p>

    <p><center>The 1920s was a period of massive growth and innovation in music, witnessing the first electrical recordings, the explosion of jazz music, the proliferation of gramophone players, the beginnings of music radio, and even the advent of the BBC. 

        Today, the Roaring 20s is most familiar as the dawn of the Jazz Age, giving rise to many stars who remain popular to this day. Mixing elements of blues, ragtime, marching music and African folk rhythms, this new style of music felt fresh and exciting, and was central to the burgeoning interwar youth culture arguably the first recognised youth subculture. 
   
        With a combination of motor vehicles, relative economic affluence after the First World War, and the extension of compulsory education, young people found themselves with more freedom than before, and their new-found free time was often spent dancing and listening to the latest music. The looser clothes styles popularised at this time lent themselves to energetic dances like the Charleston, Shimmy and Black Bottom that became virtually inseparable from jazz music.</center></p>
