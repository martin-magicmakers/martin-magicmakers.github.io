<p><center>As always, the line between decades blurred with the 1940s and 1980s-inspired looks that began in the noughties continuing into the beginning of the 2010s. Nipped-in waists and shift dresses like those seen on the Elie Saab runway for Fall 2011 , pencil skirts and cardigans, and platform heels all contributed to a feminine professional look in the early part of the decade. 
    
    This started to soften with fuller skirts inching their way towards the midi-look that would be popular in the middle of the decade. Waists remained firmly defined, often with an oversized belt to emphasize it. Phoebe Philo’s Spring 2012 collection for Celine featured wide, matching belts heavily throughout the collection, paired with overcoats, dresses, and trousers alike. Burberry similarly employed belts in the same season, though Christopher Bailey used decidedly brighter colors for his collection . The overall effect was the same: to define the waist and create a classic, feminine silhouette now veering towards a fuller 1950s look. In some cases, this also created a peplum effect, another silhouette that was popular during this period.Similarly, a focus on sustainability caused many consumers to think twice about their fashion choices and its impact on the environment. But thinking twice and doing something were two separate things. Though many brands made gestures towards becoming more sustainable, as with the working conditions of factory workers, substantial change was not forthcoming.

    Despite moves towards more diversity and inclusion throughout the industry, several brands were rightly called out for racist products and campaigns. In a tumultuous decade, the designers behind Dolce&Gabbana created controversy after controversy. In 2012, their collection for Spring 2013 featured Blackamoor earrings and screen printing, ignoring the connotations of slavery the imagery produced. Later in 2016, the brand would come under further fire for describing a pair of shoes as “slave sandals” on their website.In 2018, a culturally insensitive video ahead of a huge show in China found them under the spotlight for racism once again. This was made worse by Instagram DMs seemingly showing Stefano Gabbana making further racist comments about China (the brand maintains that the account had been hacked). 

    While Dolce&Gabbana had several incidents, they were by no means alone. In 2018, Prada was called out for figurines that echoed the racist cartoonish imagery of Sambo and blackface. They pulled the pieces and apologized, but for many, the damage was done. Similarly, Gucci had to pull a balaclava-style sweater that looked eerily like blackface when worn.
    
    Throughout the 2010s, technology and social media allowed more and more people to engage with fashion. But the same platforms that allowed fashion to be enjoyed by all also shone a light on the ugly side of fashion in a way that had not been done before. </center></p>

<p><center>The 2010s in music were characterized by significant shifts in industry dynamics and cultural trends, shaped by the rise of digital streaming platforms, social media, and globalization. The decade saw the domination of genres such as pop, hip-hop, and electronic dance music (EDM), while independent artists gained unprecedented visibility through online platforms. The 2010s also witnessed the revival of vinyl records, the emergence of viral hits through platforms like YouTube and TikTok, and increasing discussions about diversity, representation, and social issues within the music industry.By the mid-2010s, the hushed style of vocal delivery commonly used in indie music garnered widespread popularity among pop artists, used often by Selena Gomez, Lana Del Rey, Lorde and Birdy. The Guardian dubbed this style as "whisperpop", characterized by subdued vocals, muted notes and breathy intensity.dult contemporary music had been successful on the charts. Pop acts like Taylor Swift, Justin Bieber, Bruno Mars, Ed Sheeran, Adele, P!nk, Shawn Mendes, Kelly Clarkson, and Maroon 5 had achieved a No. 1 single during the decade. Artists like Sara Bareilles, Jason Mraz, Michael Bublé, Charlie Puth, Colbie Caillat, Christina Perri, CeeLo Green, and Shawn Mendes all incorporated soul, pop rock, and folk into their music.[4]

    Throughout the 2010s, hip hop music grew as a genre. In 2017, with the increase in streaming services influence over the Billboard Hot 100 rap music became the most popular genre in the US in its 4th decade of growth, surpassing Rock and Pop music.[5] Artists like Kendrick Lamar, Drake, Future, Chance the Rapper, Nicki Minaj, Travis Scott, Playboi Carti, J. Cole, Gucci Mane, Migos, Young Thug, Lil B, Tyler, The Creator, ASAP Rocky, 21 Savage, Cardi B, Big Sean, Lil Uzi Vert, Lil Yachty, XXXTentacion and Juice WRLD all rose to prominence in this decade. In the decade, movements like Trap music, Cloud rap, Drill music, and Emo hip hop became mainstream.[6] The 2010s are also notable for the increasing prominence of rap producers; examples being Young Chop, Lex Luger, Sonny Digital, DJ Mustard, Metro Boomin, Southside, DJ Khaled and Pi'erre Bourne .
    
    Progressive and experimental rock have started to become widespread, mainly in the second half of the decade. Artists, such as Nothing More, Highly Suspect, Twelve Foot Ninja, Dead Letter Circus, and Marmozets, and DIY ethic bands, including Bad Omens, Sylar, Æges, and Silver Snakes, have enjoyed success through concerts and streaming services.
    
    EDM had become more mainstream mostly due to the release of Britney Spears' Blackout (2007); some 2010s successes include David Guetta, Skrillex, Steve Aoki, Swedish House Mafia, Headhunterz, Wildstylez, Da Tweekaz, Clean Bandit, Major Lazer, DVBBS, Avicii, Alesso, Owl City, The Chainsmokers, Calvin Harris, DJ Snake, Diplo, ShockOne, Drumsound&Bassline Smith, Blasterjaxx, Martin Garrix, Marshmello, Alan Walker and Zedd. The prominence of novel EDM genres in the pop sphere like Future Bass and Trap (EDM) resulted in newer styles and innovations within the dance-pop sound, though house genres like future house, tropical house, and electro house remained the most common regardless. The latter was especially popular in the early part of the decade continuing from the late 2000s. Reggaetón and Dancehall were other major influences for many dance-pop hits.</center></p>
