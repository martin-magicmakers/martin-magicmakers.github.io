<p><center>As the Swinging Sixties turned into the 1970s, the influence of boutique stores and diffusion lines made ready-to-wear clothing increasingly accessible. New synthetic fabrics meant that fashionable styles could be bought at any price point. So pervasive were these materials that the seventies became known as the “Polyester Decade.” The decade saw a wide range of popular styles: from the early prairie dresses influenced by hippie fashion, to the flashy party wear worn to disco nightclubs, to the rise of athletic wear as the decade looked towards the 1980s, the seventies was a decade that explored fashion, but also looked back.
    Seventies fashion began with a continuation of the late 1960s hippie style. In the early 1970s, this meant an emphasis on handmade materials and decorations. While the hippies of the sixties had embraced these items as a way of rejecting mainstream fashion, designers in the early seventies began to incorporate them into their high fashion collections. Patchwork, crochet and knitting, embroidery were among the details used by designers. The silk evening gown by Zandra Rhodes shows how patterns and the loose, flowing quality of the hippie style crept into high fashion. “Quilting, felting, dyeing, beading, smocking, leather craft and hand-painted fabrics were also reclaimed from craft fairs for the fashion world,” says Daniel Milford-Cottam in Fashion in the 1970s (15). The styles from Seventeen magazine show an influence from homemade crafts in the embroidered patterns  while being made in the decade’s signature polyester .As women gained more opportunity to work outside the home, they looked for clothing, like trousers and the wrap dress, that afforded them more freedom. Later in the decade, fashion became even more comfortable. As the 1970s slipped into the 1980s, an emphasis on personal fitness foreshadowed the rise of athletic wear as informal wear . James Laver writes in Costume and Fashion: A Concise History, “In the late 1970s the American designer Norma Kamali was instrumental in bringing sportswear into the fashion arena, introducing sweat-shirting, ra-ra skirts, bandeau tops, jumpsuits, leotards and leggings” (272). These styles would, of course, come to typify 1980s fashion, but originated in the later years of the seventies.</center></p>

<p><center>The 70s saw the release of groundbreaking movies and TV shows that would forever alter the course of modern culture. Shows like "Happy Days," "MAS*H," and "Charlie's Angels," and films like "Star Wars," "The Godfather," and "Rocky" became immortal cultural touchstones.

    The era also marked an important chapter in music history, with many 70s singers rising to global stardom. These influential artists and the timeless hits they created continue to inspire generations - evidenced by the fact that two out of six of the best-selling albums of all time were released in the late 70s.
    
    From the groundbreaking psychedelic rock of Pink Floyd to the disco fever of Donna Summer, 70s music was bustling with diversity and innovation, laying the foundation for some of today’s musical styles as a timeless inspiration to the contemporary musical landscape of our generation.The 70s music scene witnessed the rise of iconic singers and bands who carved a name for themselves in music history and contributed to the list of record-breaking 70s music hits.

    Led Zeppelin, with their groundbreaking album "Led Zeppelin IV," served as the voice of the era's rock scene, defining a generation with legendary tracks like "Stairway to Heaven." 
    
    Meanwhile, Stevie Wonder’s fame soared with his masterpiece album "Songs in the Key of Life," which showcased a profoundly soulful, genre-defying piece of work that remains an unmatched testament to his artistry. 
    
    Disco fever took the world by storm with the arrival of Donna Summer's "I Feel Love," a revolutionary track that dominated dance floors and revolutionized electronic music production. 
    
    The Bee Gees and their album "Saturday Night Fever" became synonymous with disco and pumped out the chart-topping tracks "Stayin' Alive" and "Night Fever." As a result, they grew into legacies that withstood the test of time and defined the era of best 70s songs.The impact that 70s music had extends far beyond the confines of its decade, to inspire contemporary sounds and styles. 

    Artists like David Bowie, known for his unapologetic experimentalism and flamboyant persona, not only shaped the music of his own time, but also inspired future generations of musicians to challenge stylistic conventions with albums like "The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the “Spiders from Mars."
    
    The funk-infused sounds of Parliament-Funkadelic and their leader, George Clinton, established a blueprint that continues to influence today's hip-hop, R&B, and funk music. Their innovative use of rhythm, instrumentation layering techniques, and cosmic themes set them apart as pioneers of their time, inspiring countless artists across various genres.
    
    Included in our list of the five best music collaborations of all time is Nile Rodgers’ (a Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Songwriters Hall of Fame inductee from the 70s music scene) iconic collaborative effort with Daft Punk and Pharrell Williams - “Get Lucky.” This track embodies harmonious cross-generational collaboration - mixing a classic 70s music style with a contemporary one.</center></p>
