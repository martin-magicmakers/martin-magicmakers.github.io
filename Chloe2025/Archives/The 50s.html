<p><center>Fashion is rarely contained neatly in one decade, and the popular look that dominated womenswear in the 1950s actually emerged in the late 1940s. When Christian Dior’s “New Look” appeared in February 1947, it became an instant success and the nipped-in waist and full-skirted silhouette remained the leading style until the mid-1950s. As the decade progressed, the dominant silhouette became progressively straighter and slimmer, and as fashion began to look to the new “teenager” for inspiration, the elegance and formality of the early part of the decade began to lessen.

   As the 1950s began, the initial resistance to the extravagance of the New Look had died down and the silhouette was entrenched in both women’s daywear and eveningwear.Though it became increasingly acceptable for women to wear slacks for some occasions, overall the fashion mood in the fifties leaned towards femininity and formality. This was especially true in eveningwear as the cocktail dress was introduced to the public. Worn to the new cocktail party, these dresses lay in-between daywear and evening gowns, falling at the length of a day dress but embellished like eveningwear . For formal eveningwear, even as sheaths and form-fitting dresses became popular, the full-skirted dress remained the mode throughout the decade, like the highly embellished evening gown by Dior . The relatively new strapless bodice was especially popular as the pared-down bodice balanced out the wide skirts.

   No matter what time of day, throughout the decade, it was exceedingly important that a woman be impeccably turned out. This meant perfectly groomed hair, spotless makeup, and sets of matching accessories. This was encouraged through the glamorous fashion photography of the day . Fashion historian Gerda Buxbaum writes in Icons of Fashion: The 20th Century, “The long years of deprivation during World War II brought forth a yearning for luxury and fashionable things, and women made a special effort to dress appropriately for every occasion; it was considered imperative that one’s accessories matched perfectly”. Whether she was wearing a twinset and slacks, a poodle skirt, a sheath dress, or one of Dior’s New Look styles, a woman did her best to ensure that she looked pulled together through her accessories and overall styling. Those infamous black-toed Chanel shoes  appeared at the end of this decade, after all.</center></p>

<p><center>1950’s music.  It was the decade that fired rock ‘n’ roll into the mainstream and created the concept of teenagers. It was the decade in which the foundations of pop music were laid, to be built on in the years to come. For young people, the 1950’s was a cultural revolution. Popular culture made the jump into something a little more rebellious. Whether it be the raw rock ‘n’ roll of Elvis, the melodic country sound of Johnny Cash or the rhythmic blues of Ray Charles, the 1950’s was a decade full of musical innovation and variation.Rock ‘n’ roll music was born from a fusion of rhythm and blues and country. Emerging in the early 1950’s, the genre began the chain of events that would result in the creation of rock; metal, punk, indie, britpop, grunge and the rest. The pioneers of rock ‘n’ roll included the king himself, Elvis Presley, as well as Jerry Lee Lewis, Buddy Holly and Chuck Berry, to name a few. Classics such as Johnny B Goode (which at the time many people were not ready for, but their kids were gonna love it), Jailhouse Rock and Rock Around the Clock inspired teenagers worldwide and shocked their parents in equal measure. However, 1950’s music wasn’t all swaying hips and gelled-back hair, as country music also evolved during this decade. Artists such as Johnny Cash and Hank Williams made their mark, introducing rockabilly influences and making dancing to country music possible. Finally. Cash was famous for playing to prison inmates, a trend which would continue beyond the decade and result in Cash’s famous live album At Folsom Prison in 1968.Rhythm and blues also had a huge impact on 1950’s music. Emerging from the jazz and blues of the 1940’s, artists like Ray Charles helped inspire genres such as soul, Motown and funk. The upbeat bluesy nature of the music brought the New Orleans scene to the mainstream and inspired a new wave of jazz and blues fans.</center></p>
