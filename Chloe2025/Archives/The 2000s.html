<p><center>At the turn of the millennium, fashion looked to the future as technology began seeing the rapid development that would lead to the widespread use of smartphones and social media by the end of the decade. The emphasis on new technology inspired fashion with metallic silvers, blacks and the use of straps and belts to create a Matrix-esque look.Designers even collaborated with fast-fashion retailers to bring affordable versions of their designs to consumers. In November 2004, H&M debuted their first designer collaboration with Karl Lagerfeld (Fig. 12). The affordably-priced pieces were an instant hit and mostly sold out on the first day to the surprise of both H&M and Lagerfeld himself. At the time, H&M Marketing Director Jörgen Andersson told WWD, “We’ve been operating this business for some 60 years and we’ve never seen anything like it” (Truly Fast Fashion). The frenzy was seen across stores in the US and Europe with some stores selling out in less than 20 minutes. The success led to H&M collaborating with other high fashion designers over the years with other retailers like Target following suit.

    The rise of fast fashion was aided by online retail. From the technology-inspired clothing at the turn of the millennium to the sharing of trends through social media to the sale of fashion online, the story of fashion in the 2000s was linked to technology from beginning to end.</center></p>

<p><center>The 2000's continued many of the trends that emerged in the mid and late 1990's.  Hip hop music had taken the place of rock music and the pop world of music was primarily controlled by major brand executives that were building groups using formulas created in the 1990s.  In Pop music you saw a blended sound of rock, pop, hip hop and country music as artists like Lady Gaga and Kelly Clarkson take center stage next to many of the popular groups of the 1990s.

    By the end of the 2000's Pop music was so broad that country music had grown in popularity throughout the United States thanks to artists like Taylor Swift and Carrie Underwood that gained popularity with a new more mainstream sound, exposure using the internet and television programming and aggressive marketing to the youth markets.
    
    Many artist experimented with various genres throughout the 2000's and some like Taylor Swift successfully made the transition.  Another example of this was Alternative artist Darius Rucker who left his band Hootie and the Blowfish to begin a solo career in country music.  For those artists that still could not find a genre that fit, Emo filled that void with bands like Dashboard Confessionals and  Fall Out Boys.
    
    But, by far the most successful genre in music in the 2000's was hip hop with revolutionary artists like Kanye West and Eminem redefining the industry and infusing a sound and a message many of the youth and young professional could relate to.  The Hip Hop industry would continue to thrive throughout the 2000's and become increasingly mainstream.  By the time the 2010's arrived hip hop music was the most popular form of music in America.
    
    By the end of the 1990s, mainstream tastes leaned toward pop music. A plethora of boy bands, girl bands, and pop starlets emerged, more often than not created by talent scouts. These groups were aggressively marketed to teen audiences.  The 2000s began right where the 1990s left off, with young singers such as Christina Aguilera and Destiny’s Child ruling the pop charts. Pop music stayed strong throughout the decade with Gwen Stefani, Beyoncé, Katy Perry, and Lady Gaga achieving mainstream success.  By the end of the decade, country artists, like Carrie Underwood and Taylor Swift, transitioned from country stars to bona fide pop stars. The first decade of this millennium saw country music flourish, opening its doors to a more eclectic sound while keeping its tradition of thought-provoking lyrics. From seasoned legends to tween newcomers, the country music pool diversified hugely in the first decade of the 2000s -- not only in demographics but also in sound.  The age-old debate of "too country" versus "too pop" found even playing field, as both traditional and modern country music thrived in the 10 years from 2000 to 2009. Read on for a look back at the 2000s biggest moments, songs and more. </center></p>
