<p><center>The close of the 1930s had brought with it the start of World War II. As World War I had in the 1910s, WWII had a profound impact on fashion in the first half of the 1940s, and even after the war had ended. France, the United Kingdom, and the United States all had distinct fashion stories during the first half of the 1940s due to the impact of the war. After the war, those fashion stories began intersecting again with the arrival of Christian Dior's New Look.</center></p>
<p><center>Furthering the fashionability of Utility garments in the UK was the Incorporated Society of London Fashion Designers or Inc. Soc. for short. Designers such as Norman Hartnell, Hardy Amies, and Edward Molyneux submitted designs for the scheme. Fashion historian Jayne Shrimpton writes in Fashion in the 1940s, “The [Utility Clothing] initiative might never have succeeded had the government not taken the inspired decision to involve leading London couturiers in the design of Utility clothing” . So, while the look of Utility clothing may have been simple, it had the cachet of being designed by leading London designers and the Utility suit by Hardy Amies demonstrates how these suits were styled with aplomb.To those who had become used to the simple lines of Utility clothing and using every scrap of material they could get their hands on, the full skirt of the New Look was jarring. The “Chérie” dress  boasted tight pleating, adding to the large amount of fabric required to create the look. With some styles using up to fifteen yards of fabric, it was viewed by some as wasteful. Still, other women feared its blatant femininity would set back the progress women had made working outside the home during the war. Despite these controversies, the New Look silhouette continued to be popular into the later 1940s and was the predominant silhouette in women's fashion by 1949 and stayed that way well into the 1950s.</center></p>

<p><center>To bolster the war effort, patriotic music became particularly popular during the decade, namely Kate Smith's rendition of “God Bless America” and “Boogie Woogie Bugle Boy” by The Andrew Sisters. The song told the tale of a young man drafted for the army who becomes a bugle boy for his company of soldiers. Listeners of the radio also adored the romantic classics of big stars. Bing Crosby’s song “You Made Me Love You” was an uplifting and fun hit released at the start of the decade. 

    The jazz vocal group The Ink Spots dominated popular music of the 1940’s with hits such as “We Three” and “I Don't Want to Set the World on Fire.” They also collaborated with Ella Fitzgerald in the song “I'm Making Believe.”  Fitzgerald was a rising star in the jazz music industry, who would skyrocket to fame in the 1950s. The Ink Spots’ style had a lovely, smooth quality, effortlessly gliding over the guitar and piano instrumentals. 
    
    The popularity of Big Band jazz spilled over from the 20’s and 30’s into the World War II era. Harlem Renaissance musicians like Duke Ellington and Louis Armstrong participated in the scene, but the most popular Big Band of the decade was led by Glenn Miller. The Glenn Miller Orchestra’s music was characterized by catchy riffs, which showcased the band’s saxophonists and trumpeter. Their most popular hit was “In the Mood,” a widely recognizable song, if not by name, then by ear. The Big Band music of the 40’s was upbeat and impeccably arranged. 
    
    Aside from his music, Glenn Miller is also famous for his mysterious disappearance in 1944. Heading for Paris in a small military plane, Miller was last in contact over the British Channel and was never seen again. The case remains unsolved and a multitude of conspiracy theories surround his strange war-time disappearance. 
    
    The end of World War II heralded the transition away from the Big Band music that typified the culture of the decades prior. The career of Louis Armstrong, a jazz phenomenon, reflected this change.
    
    “During the early 1940's, Louis Armstrong performed primarily with big bands. During these years, his popularity declined. Armstrong was a performer and did not have the discipline or organizational skills required of a successful bandleader.”
    
    As the 1940s, a decade of worldwide grief, came to a close, popular bands began to feature vocals rather than instruments; the 1950s would produce some of the most popular jazz, rock, and blues vocalists of all time. </center></p>
