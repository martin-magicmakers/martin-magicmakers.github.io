                    <p><center>The fashions of the 2020s represent a departure from 2010s fashion and feature a nostalgia for older aesthetics.[1] They have been largely inspired by styles of the late 1990s to mid-2000s, and 1980s.[2][3][4] Early in the decade, several publications noted the shortened trend and nostalgia cycle in 2020s fashion.[5][6][7][8][9] Fashion was also shaped by the COVID-19 pandemic, which had a major impact on the fashion industry, and led to shifting retail and consumer trends.

                        In the 2020s, many companies, including current fast fashion giants such as Shein and Temu, have been using social media platforms such as TikTok and Instagram as a marketing tool.[10] Marketing strategies involving third parties, particularly influencers and celebrities, have become prominent tactics. E-commerce platforms which promote small businesses,[11] such as Depop and Etsy, grew by offering vintage, homemade, or resold clothing from individual sellers. Thrifting has also exploded in popularity due to it being centered around finding valuable pieces of clothing at a reasonable price.[12]</center></p>

                    <p><center>Whether it’s knowing every single lyric to songs on the radio, or listening to all different types of music, I am proud to say that I am a music nerd. Since accepting the fact that I am a ‘music nerd’ I have started paying more attention to some trends that have developed throughout the last few years. One of those trends is more alternative-sounding pop and rap music. Another popular trend is re-used beats from the ‘90s R&B. More recently, I found myself or my friends hearing music that sounded similar to older songs my parents would listen to in the car. I never thought much of it until some of the newer rap songs included more ‘reused beats’ found in 90’s R&B music. Another thing that has become more typical in newer music is the use of more alternative-sounding beats. This sound has been used more in rap music, as well as in some pop songs.
                        A new music trend that has been seen in many rappers is the use of alternative-sounding music. Some recent albums that are following this are the new Utopia, Life of a Don, and SOS. For anyone who follows the music world, one of the most anticipated albums of the year dropped this last week. But for some, it wasn’t what was expected of the famed artist. On October 5th 2023, Drake dropped his album “For All The Dogs.” Along with the anticipation of the album, many people speculated that the new music would follow the flow of Drake’s previous album, “Her Loss.” However, the album did quite the contrary, following more of an alternative sound that we heard in “Honestly Nevermind.” When asked, many people think that the new album does in fact follow the alternative beats in “Honestly Nevermind.” People believe the music has a very chill vibe to it. Personally, I think the new album is great, and one of the best albums released this year. In the album, most, if not all of the songs have an alternative feel, but also tie in popular rap as well. “For All The Dogs” is a fantastically chill everyday album that perfectly falls into the alternative rap genre.
                        Another music trend that has become popular recently is the use of ‘90s beats in new music. Using beats from a different song is called “sampling” and is referred to as reuse. Whether it is obvious or not, there are lots of new songs that tie these beats in. Some of the most popular songs that include reused beats are “It’s Getting Hot” by NLE Choppa. This song is a spin-off of the song “Hot in Herre” by Nelly. The original song was released in 2002 and was a huge hit. This is a good example of obvious reuse, however, not every single song follows this trend. Another song that is not so obvious is “Paint the Town Red‘ by Doja Cat. This song samples from a ‘60s song called “Walk On By” by Dionne Warwick. There are so many sampled songs that are on the radio or any other streaming service. Some argue that sampling is proving there are only so many beat combos that can be used, and current artists are relying on sampling now. Others argue that sampling is just for fun and a great twist to normal music.
                        Between the two music trends, I don’t think it would be fair to say that one trend is more important than the other. Both of these influence popular music greatly and will most definitely continue to do so as the years go on. However, I encourage you to listen for the alternative in your daily spin of music and pay attention to any samples you hear.</center></p>
