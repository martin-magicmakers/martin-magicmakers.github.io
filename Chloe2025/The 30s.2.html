                    <p><center>As the 1920s turned into the 1930s, womens fashion softly evolved from the boyish look of the previous decade into the feminine silhouette of the early thirties. With the stock market crash in 1929 and with the opening of the new decade, hemlines descended back to ankle length and waistlines moved back to their natural place.
                        Despite these departures from the prevailing mode of the previous decade, the popular styles of the early 1930s were similar in their simple lines to the popular garçonne look of the twenties. But while the simplicity of the 1920s created a sack-like silhouette free from curves, the simple lines of the early thirties hugged those curves, creating a soft, feminine silhouette. Cally Blackman, a lecturer on the history of fashion at Central Saint Martins, writes in 100 Years of Fashion, “By the early 1930s, the fashionable silhouette was evolving into a slender, elongated torso with widening shoulders and a neat head with softly waved short hair” . Though the lines were simple, the overall effect was one of complete sinuous femininity with a natural waist and skirts flaring out slightly at the ankle, as seen in a fashion illustration from 1935. Having gained popularity in the 1920s, designer Elsa Schiaparelli took her designs to another level in the 1930s, collaborating with surrealist artists such as Salvador Dalí and Jean Cocteau.</center></p>
                    <p><center>Of course, the Depression also had an influence on fashion, contributing to this democratization, especially in the United States. Before the 1930s, buyers would purchase copies of Paris designs and resell them in their home countries. However, as the Great Depression affected all areas of business and life in the US, new duties of ninety percent were imposed on the cost of these copies.By the end of the decade, Europe had entered into the Second World War and the US still had not yet left the Great Depression behind. As the thirties closed, the popular style of broad, padded shoulders, nipped in waists and shorter A-line skirts that would dominate the early 1940s had already emerged.</center></p>

                    <p><center>As the 1920s wore into the 1930s, jazz continued to dominate the music scene, airing on BBC radio programmes and enjoying print coverage in Melody Maker magazine, which had launched in 1926. During this time, fashions steadily shifted away from the rougher, New Orleans style “hot” jazz towards smoother, more highly arranged styles. Swing jazz  characterised by its emphasis on the “off-beat” was in the ascendancy, with the period 1935 to 1946 often referred to as the “Swing Era”.

                        Band leaders from Glenn Miller and Benny Goodman to Duke Ellington and Louis Armstrong fronted sprawling jazz "orchestras", and growing access to records and radios helped them make their name internationally as well as across the US. Scat singing, popularised with Armstrong’s “Heebie Jeebies” in 1926, became more widely adopted, with Cab Calloway exemplifying this energetic, improvised vocal style throughout the 1930s.s talking pictures and movie musicals firmly established their place in popular culture, songs from the cinema became a mainstay with young people. Gone were the days of actors as purely physical performers; now “triple-threats” like Bing Crosby, Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers were shooting to international stardom. And of course, the decade ended with Judy Garland’s iconic performance of “Somewhere Over the Rainbow” in Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer’s enormously influential The Wizard of Oz.
                    
                        The 1930s also saw huge strides in animation, including the first ever fully animated feature film with Disney's Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs dazzling viewers in 1937, setting the model for a whole series of animated movies full of catchy songs. Nor was it only features that were reflecting and shaping the musical landscape: music was a key ingredient in the zany cartoons created by Max Fleischer particularly Betty Boop, who was conceived as a caricature of the jazz age flapper. Betty Boop made her first appearance in 1930, and in 1933, starred in a rather different Snow White adaptation, featuring Cab Calloway as the voice of Koko the Clown in the masterful “St James Infirmary Blues” sequence below.
